# Automated Drink Umbrella ☂️

I've been automating many things in my apartment (see my [Home Assistant configuration](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/home-assistant-configuration) for some examples). I've found that I want ways for the automations to interact with me in a passive way, without sending push notifications or distracting me with sounds.

One simple, common issue I have is checking the weather in the morning. Do I grab my ☂️ or not?

This project adds an automated drink umbrella as a method of displaying the chance of precipitation. I've also added a ring of RGB LEDs inside the wooden base, which lets the unit express other information such a temperature and other important notifications.
